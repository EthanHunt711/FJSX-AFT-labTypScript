## EASY TO BORROW BANK

This is a small project in learning the basics of TypeScript.

### Structure and design

The page contains four sections/cards the user reads first about the mortgage process and calculation. In the second section/card the user can try different sums of mortgage or payback plans for comparsion. The results are shown in the table in the last card so one can easily look at previous calculations and amounts.

Since the calculation is not based on an individual evaluation of the applicants economic situation, a series of general requirements are set for limits to the mortgage size or the payback plan. If there is a larger than usual sum for mortgage or a longer than usual payback period or even an unusual interest rate a new card is shown with how the bank thinks anout this.

### Disclaimer

The page is just designed for big screens and there is no responsive requirement. Furthermore, the page is not using localStorage as it was not required to do so.
